About FlavorGraph
* Implications and promises
* Understand the data and methods
* Processing (only use hub ingredients)

Shoutout to Epicure
* Trying to mimic
* Explain what they have done (to my knowledge)
  * Combining ingredients in a way

Try own methods
* Adding/average embeddings together
  * Cosine similarities
  * Why average=adding when computing cosine-sim
* Smallest "valid" subgraph
  * Weighted (Steiner Tree)
  * Un-weighted 
* Find overlap in embeddings and graphs
  * No real overlap
  * Graph is more precise
  * Embedding properties don't seem quite right
* Suggest food predictor/recommender

Colorful, intuitive graphs
* Insert food image inside nodes
* Node colors should reflect food color
* Distance should be meaningful

Food manifold
* T-SNE plots
  * Interactive for zooming in
* Insert edge within T-SNE plot?

MAKE SURE TO EMBED A BOKEH PLOT
